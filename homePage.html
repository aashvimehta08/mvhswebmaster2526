        Tissue engineering is one of the most rapidly advancing fields in biotechnology, with the potential to transform modern medicine. It focuses on creating biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function. Despite significant progress, one major limitation remains: obtaining enough viable cells to construct functional tissues.
Cells form the foundation of any engineered tissue, yet collecting and reproducing them at scale is a persistent challenge. Many cells harvested directly from the human body deteriorate during extraction or lose their regenerative potential after multiple replications in laboratory settings. These cells can also become prone to contamination or mutations, reducing their reliability.
